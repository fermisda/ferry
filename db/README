We are using http://www.dbschema.com/ tool to design FERRY database.

Restoring a FERRY dump (.sql) into PostgreSQL

 - Make sure you have PostgreSQL 9.2.18 (or compatible version) installed in your machine.
 - Open PostgreSQL as postgres user
 - Create ferry user: postgres=# CREATE USER ferry WITH PASSWORD 'password';
 - Create ferry database: postgres=# CREATE DATABASE ferry OWNER ferry; # You can change the db name to better suit your enviroment e.g. ferry_test.
 - Now exit PostgreSQL and clone FERRY repository: git clone ssh://p-ferment@cdcvs.fnal.gov/cvs/projects/ferment ferry
 - Restore the most recent ferry dump: psql -U postgres -W ferry < ferry/db/dumps/ferry-2017-07-07.sql
